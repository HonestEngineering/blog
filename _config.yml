  We are a group of fellow engineers who want to share an honest vision of the current state of web engineering. 
  Most of articles are either self promotions, or too opinionated.
  We want to share honest and unbiased thought about the current state of tech. 
  Our mission is to help fellow engineers forge their own opinion on current trendy and controversial subjects.
